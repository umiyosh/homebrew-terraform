# homebrew-terraform v0.6.16

This formula installs terraform [v0.6.16](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.6.16/terraform_0.6.16_darwin_amd64.zip). I will keep my homebrew-core Formula as it install. It imitates the formula of [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core) terraform in v0.6.16 as it is.

``` bash
brew tap umiyosh/homebrew-terraform
brew install umiyosh/terraform/terraform
```
